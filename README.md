# The Video Game Publisher Graph

![Graph!](https://github.com/badcf00d/video-game-publishers-graphviz/releases/latest/download/publishers.png)

A graphviz chart of the corporate structures of top video game publishers.

Generally a studio is shown if there is a widely available logo used to represent them, otherwise it is probably more accurate to consider them part of the parent company, rather than a seperate studio.

#### How To Use
 - Install dependencies `sudo apt install graphviz imagemagick optipng`
 - (Optional) Install the [Fira font](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira)
 - Generate the graph `make`
